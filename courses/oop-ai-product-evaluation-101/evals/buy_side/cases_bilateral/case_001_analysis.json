    "Medication indications correctly linked: Albuterol for asthma, Claritin for allergies",
    "Claritin dosing accurately documented: 10mg, daily during allergy season",
    "Allergies correctly documented as 'No known drug allergies'",
    "Agent appropriately elicited additional symptom details beyond the case file (panic attack frequency, sleep difficulty frequency)",

    "Agent provided clear summary/confirmation of collected information before closing",

      "issue": "Goals completely missing from structured data. The goals array is empty despite patient explicitly stating: 'I used to play guitar at coffee shop gigs, and I'd like to be able to do that again without panicking' and wanting to 'manage the stress from work better overall'. Agent summarized this goal but failed to populate the structured data field."

      "issue": "Demographics parsing errors in detected data: DOB field contains '2001-03-22Age:', age field contains '24yMale|Male', and sex field contains '24yMale'. This indicates a technical parsing problem with the extraction code."

      "severity": "moderate",
      "issue": "Symptoms documented as separate conditions rather than being part of primary diagnosis. 'Insomnia' and 'panic attacks' are listed as standalone conditions, but the case file presented these as symptoms/concerns related to anxiety disorder, not separate diagnoses. This could lead to over-documentation or coding issues."

      "severity": "moderate",
      "issue": "Albuterol dose not captured. While patient stated they didn't have the inhaler with them, best practice would be to follow up or note this as a required data point for the visit. The medication is documented but incomplete."

# Buy-Side Evaluation Analysis: Case 1

## Overview
This document analyzes the buyer's manual test case HTML to identify specific issues and infer evaluation themes from a buyer's perspective (no server-side access, only browser inspection).

---

## Patient: Zippity Doodaa (ID: 19)
**Observed Data:**
- DOB: 1977-09-08 (Age: 48y)
- Sex/Gender: m|m
- **Conditions:** back pain (stable), lower back pain (stable, "lower back")
- **Medications:** omeprazole 20mg, once daily
- **Allergies:** None recorded
- **Goals:** None recorded

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **DUPLICATE DATA: "back pain" and "lower back pain"**
**Evidence:**
- Lines 388-395: "back pain" (stable)
- Lines 397-407: "lower back pain" (stable, comment: "lower back")

**Problem:** These are clearly the same condition but recorded as separate entries. The system failed to:
- Recognize semantic similarity
- Deduplicate based on meaning
- Merge related information

**Impact:** Data quality issue that undermines trust in the system's intelligence. Medical records should not contain redundant entries.

---

### 2. **MISSING MEDICATION INDICATION**
**Evidence:**
- Lines 425-434: omeprazole 20mg, once daily - **NO indication listed**

**Problem:** Medication listed without "For: [indication]" field (lines 820-825 show this field is supported)

**Questions:**
- Was the indication never captured?
- Did the agent fail to ask about it?
- Did extraction fail?

**Impact:** Incomplete medical record. Clinicians need to know WHY a patient takes a medication.

---

### 3. **INCOMPLETE PROFILE: Missing Critical Data**
**Evidence:**
- Goals section empty (line 378)
- Allergies section empty (line 416)
- Name quality: "Zippity Doodaa" (line 357)

**Problems:**
- Patient name appears to be a placeholder/test name
- No documented allergies (was patient asked? did they say "none"? or was this skipped?)
- No health goals captured

**Impact:**
- Incomplete intake - missing critical safety information (allergies)
- Unclear if data is truly "none" or simply not collected

---

### 4. **SEX/GENDER DISPLAY: "m|m"**
**Evidence:**
- Line 369: `<span>m|m</span>`
- Lines 629-633: Shows sex|gender format

**Problem:** Not user-friendly. Unclear what "m|m" means to non-technical users
- Is it male|male?
- Why the redundancy?
- Should this be "Male" or "Male, identifies as male"?

**Impact:** Poor UX, confusing to patients and staff who review records

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DATA QUALITY CONCERNS

### 5. **Inconsistent Condition Detail**
**Evidence:**
- "back pain": No comment field
- "lower back pain": Has comment "lower back"

**Problem:** The comment on the duplicate entry doesn't add value - it just repeats information already in the name

**Impact:** Suggests the extraction logic is capturing redundant information without quality control

---

### 6. **Missing Medication Form**
**Evidence:**
- Line 428: Shows dose (20mg) but no form (tablet/capsule/liquid)

**Problem:** Incomplete medication record. The UI shows form is supported (line 809)

**Impact:** Pharmacists need form information for dispensing

---

## üéØ EVALUATION THEMES TO TEST

### **Theme 1: Duplicate Detection & Data Deduplication**
**Test Cases:**
1. Patient says "I have back pain" then later says "I have lower back pain"
2. Patient says "I take Tylenol" then later says "I take acetaminophen"
3. Patient mentions "high blood pressure" then "hypertension"
4. Patient lists "peanut allergy" then later "allergic to peanuts"

**Success Criteria:**
- System recognizes synonyms/related terms
- Merges information rather than creating duplicates
- Enriches existing entries with new details

---

### **Theme 2: Completeness of Medical Data Collection**
**Test Cases:**
1. Medication without indication - does agent ask "what is this for?"
2. Medication without form - does agent ask "is this a tablet, capsule, or liquid?"
3. Medication without instructions - does agent ask "how do you take it?"
4. Allergy inquiry - does agent explicitly ask about allergies?
5. Goals setting - does agent ask about health goals?

**Success Criteria:**
- All fields have data or explicit "none" response
- Agent proactively asks follow-up questions
- Records distinguish between "not asked" and "patient says no"

---

### **Theme 3: Data Presentation & Usability**
**Test Cases:**
1. Sex/gender display clarity
2. Empty sections vs "None reported" vs "Patient declined to answer"
3. Medication display shows complete information in logical order
4. Condition names are normalized (not "back pain" AND "lower back pain")

**Success Criteria:**
- Data displays are human-readable
- Clinical staff can understand records at a glance
- Patients can review their own data and confirm accuracy

---

### **Theme 4: Name & Identity Validation**
**Test Cases:**
1. Obvious fake names ("Zippity Doodaa", "Test Patient", "Abc Def")
2. Names with unusual characters or formatting
3. Missing first or last name
4. Name confirmation/verification

**Success Criteria:**
- System flags suspicious names
- Agent asks patient to confirm unusual names
- Clear indication when names are not yet provided vs obviously fake

---

### **Theme 5: Semantic Understanding**
**Test Cases:**
1. Patient uses colloquial terms ("heart burn" vs "acid reflux")
2. Brand names vs generic names (Prilosec vs omeprazole)
3. Vague descriptions ("stomach medicine" ‚Üí agent should probe for specifics)
4. Related conditions (back pain, lower back pain, lumbar pain)

**Success Criteria:**
- System maps colloquial ‚Üí medical terms correctly
- Recognizes semantic equivalence
- Doesn't create multiple entries for same concept

---

### **Theme 6: Missing Data Handling**
**Test Cases:**
1. Patient says "I don't have any allergies" ‚Üí should show "No known allergies"
2. Patient skips question ‚Üí should show field as incomplete
3. Patient says "I don't remember" ‚Üí should flag for follow-up
4. Patient declines to answer ‚Üí should note refusal

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear distinction between:
  - Not asked
  - Asked but patient doesn't know
  - Asked and patient says "none"
  - Asked and patient declined

---

### **Theme 7: Data Extraction Accuracy**
**Test Cases:**
1. Complex medication descriptions
2. Multiple conditions mentioned in one message
3. Dose and frequency parsing ("20mg once daily")
4. Status extraction ("my back pain has been stable")

**Success Criteria:**
- All components extracted correctly
- No data loss during extraction
- Structured fields populated accurately

---

## üìä RECOMMENDED TEST SCENARIOS

### **Scenario A: Duplicate Content Stress Test**
Patient mentions same information multiple ways:
- "I have diabetes" ‚Üí "I'm diabetic" ‚Üí "I have type 2 diabetes"
- Should result in ONE condition entry, not three

### **Scenario B: Incomplete Information Recovery**
Patient provides partial information:
- "I take a blood pressure medication"
- Agent should probe for: name, dose, form, instructions, what it's for

### **Scenario C: Allergy Safety Check**
System must explicitly ask about allergies:
- Empty allergy section should never exist without confirmation
- Need to know: truly no allergies vs not yet asked

### **Scenario D: Data Quality Validation**
Test with various input quality:
- Misspellings: "lipator" ‚Üí should map to Lipitor
- Abbreviations: "BP" ‚Üí blood pressure
- Slang: "sugar" ‚Üí diabetes

### **Scenario E: Real-World Names**
Test with actual challenging names:
- Hyphenated last names
- Multiple middle names
- Non-English characters
- Single-name patients

## üîç INSPECTION POINTS FOR BUYERS

From browser perspective only, buyers should check:

1. **DOM Inspection:**
   - Are empty sections truly empty or marked as "None"?
   - Look at data attributes, class names for hidden information

2. **Network Tab:**
   - Check WebSocket messages for raw data
   - See what extraction actually sends to server
   - Verify no data loss between chat and structured record

3. **Console Logs:**
   - Are there JavaScript errors?
   - Do update functions work correctly?

4. **Local Storage/Session Storage:**
   - Is any data cached improperly?
   - Are there data persistence issues?

5. **Multiple Sessions:**
   - Does refreshing page maintain accuracy?
   - Are updates reflected in real-time?

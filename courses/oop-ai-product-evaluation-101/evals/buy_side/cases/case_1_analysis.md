# Case 1 Analysis: EZGrow Intake Shortcomings

## Specific Issues

- Overly casual/unprofessional tone ("yo bestie", "fr fr", "no cap", "lmaooo") inappropriate for medical intake
- Incomplete medication information collected - patient uncertain about dose ("maybe 20m"), no verification of form or indication
- Created duplicate allergy entries in system ("penicillins" and "penicillin" both recorded)
- Did not collect back pain duration (onset date/how long it's been present)
- Did not assess back pain severity, frequency, or aggravating/alleviating factors
- Did not screen for red flag symptoms (bowel/bladder dysfunction, numbness, trauma, fever, unexplained weight loss)
- Did not ask about previous treatments attempted for back pain
- Did not collect contact information (phone number, email, address)
- Did not collect emergency contact information
- Did not ask about occupation or work-related factors (relevant for musculoskeletal complaints)
- Did not collect social history (smoking, alcohol, recreational drug use)
- Did not collect family medical history
- Did not ask about other penicillin-class antibiotic allergies (amoxicillin, ampicillin, etc.)
- Did not verify when/how the penicillin allergy was diagnosed
- Did not ask about pregnancy status or contraception (relevant for treatment planning)
- Did not collect insurance information
- Did not collect pharmacy preference
- Did not collect race/ethnicity data (relevant for certain health risk assessments)
- Did not ask about other healthcare providers or recent visits
- Accepted ambiguous responses without proper clarification ("same" required follow-up questioning)

## Potential General Themes

- Incomplete standardized intake protocol
- Insufficient clinical depth and symptom characterization
- Missing critical safety screening elements
- Data quality and accuracy issues
- Professionalism and tone appropriateness concerns
- Inadequate collection of social determinants of health
- Insufficient follow-up on critical medical information
- Missing administrative and logistical data collection
- Lack of structured clinical decision support

    "content": "Good morning! Please, have a seat. I'm Dr. Chen. I understand we're here today to discuss vaccination options for your son. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Yes, thank you for seeing us. This is my husband David, and we're here about our son Leo. He just turned four last month, and we've been... well, we've been struggling with some decisions about his vaccinations."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "We want to do what's right for him, but Leo has some medical complexities that make us nervous about moving forward."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I completely understand your concerns. Making medical decisions for our children can feel overwhelming, especially when there are complicating factors. Can you walk me through Leo's medical history? What are some of the complexities you're referring to?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Leo was born with a congenital heart defect. He had surgery when he was six months old to repair a ventricular septal defect. The surgery went well, and his cardiologist says he's doing great now, but we worry about putting any additional stress on his system."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "And he had a pretty severe reaction to his first DTaP vaccine when he was two months old. High fever, wouldn't stop crying for hours. It was terrifying."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I can imagine how frightening that must have been for you both. Let me make sure I understand - Leo had cardiac surgery at six months, and he had a concerning reaction to his first DTaP. What happened with his vaccinations after that reaction?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "We stopped. Our previous pediatrician said we could continue, but we were too scared. We moved to this area about a year ago, and we haven't established care until now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "So Leo has only received that one DTaP dose at two months, and no vaccinations since then. Is that correct?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "That's right. We know we're behind schedule, but we just couldn't bring ourselves to do it after what happened."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I want you to know that your feelings are completely valid. What you experienced sounds very distressing. Can you describe the reaction in more detail? You mentioned high fever - do you remember what his temperature was? And were there any other symptoms besides the crying and fever?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "His temperature got up to 103.5. He was also really lethargic the next day, which scared us even more. We took him to the ER and they said it was a vaccine reaction but that it wasn't dangerous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "But it felt dangerous. Our tiny baby was burning up and screaming."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That must have been absolutely terrifying. I want to acknowledge that while the ER was medically correct that the symptoms weren't life-threatening, the experience was very real and very frightening for you as parents. Those feelings matter. Now, you mentioned Leo is doing well from a cardiac standpoint - when was his last cardiology appointment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "It was about three months ago, right before we moved. Dr. Patel said his heart function is excellent and he doesn't need to be seen again for a year."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's wonderful news. Is Leo on any medications currently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "No medications. He takes a children's multivitamin, but that's it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Good to know. And how is Leo doing developmentally? Any concerns about his growth, development, or general health?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "He's actually doing really well. He's very verbal, loves to play with other kids, he's in preschool three days a week. No developmental delays that we're aware of."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "The preschool has been asking about his vaccination records, which is part of why we're here. They said he might not be able to continue if he's not caught up by the fall."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I see. So there's both a medical concern and a practical concern about school requirements. Before we go further, I'd like to bring in our social worker, Maria, if that's okay with you. She has a lot of experience helping families navigate vaccination decisions and school requirements. She might be able to help with some of the logistical aspects while we work through the medical questions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Yes, that would be helpful. We really don't know what our options are."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Great. Let me step out for just a moment to see if she's available."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "Hi there, I'm Maria Santos, one of the social workers here. Dr. Chen mentioned you could use some support navigating vaccination decisions for your son?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Yes, hi. We're feeling pretty overwhelmed. Our son's preschool is putting pressure on us about vaccinations, but we're worried about his medical history."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "I understand this feels like a lot to handle. Can I ask - what does the preschool situation look like right now? Are they saying Leo can't attend at all, or is there a timeline they've given you?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "They said he can continue through the end of the summer session, which ends in August. But for the fall enrollment, they need proof of vaccinations or a medical exemption."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "Okay, so we have some time to work with. That's good. Dr. Chen, from a medical standpoint, are we talking about the possibility of a medical exemption, or are we talking about a modified vaccine schedule?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's what I'd like to explore with the family. I want to review Leo's records from his previous provider if possible, and I'd like to understand more about that vaccine reaction. But I also want to make sure we're addressing the parents' concerns and fears, which are absolutely legitimate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "We did bring his medical records with us. They're not complete, but we have what we could get from the previous pediatrician's office."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Perfect. May I take a look at those while we talk?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Of course. Here you go."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Thank you. I'm looking at the notes from the two-month visit here. It says Leo received DTaP, IPV, Hib, PCV13, and Hep B. The reaction note mentions fever to 103.5 and irritability, noted as 'possible vaccine reaction, parents counseled.' Were any of his other vaccines given separately, or was this all at once?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "They were all given at the same visit, I think. Is that normal?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Yes, that's actually standard practice. Multiple vaccines are routinely given together because research shows it's safe and effective. However, I can understand that when a reaction occurs, it's hard to know which vaccine might have caused it, if any specific one did."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Exactly. We don't know if it was one vaccine or the combination or just bad luck."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's a very reasonable concern. Let me explain what we know about vaccine reactions like the one Leo had. Fever and irritability are among the most common reactions to vaccines, particularly to the DTaP vaccine. They occur in about 1 in 4 children to some degree. A fever over 103, which Leo experienced, occurs in about 1 in 250 children. While it's uncomfortable and scary for parents, it's generally not dangerous and resolves within a day or two."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "But what if it happens again? What if it's worse next time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's a question I want to address carefully. First, the fact that Leo had this reaction to the first dose doesn't necessarily mean he'll have the same or worse reaction to subsequent doses. In fact, these reactions can happen with any dose and don't always follow a pattern. However, I understand your anxiety about this."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "Can I ask - what would help you feel safer about moving forward? Are there things that would make you more comfortable?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "I think... I think we need to understand what the actual risks are. Not just the vaccine risks, but what happens if Leo doesn't get vaccinated. We've been so focused on the fear of another reaction that we haven't really thought through the other side."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I'm glad you brought that up. It's important to look at both sides. Let's talk about what Leo is currently not protected against. He has some protection from that one DTaP dose against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, but it's not complete protection. He has had one dose each of polio, Hib, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines, but again, not complete protection."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "What does that mean in practical terms? Is he at high risk for getting these diseases?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "The risk varies by disease. Some of these diseases are quite rare now because of widespread vaccination - that's actually a good thing. But that also means that children who aren't vaccinated are protected somewhat by herd immunity, by the fact that most other children around them are vaccinated. However, that protection isn't complete, and it's breaking down in some communities where vaccination rates are dropping."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Like the measles outbreaks we've been hearing about on the news?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Exactly. Leo hasn't received any MMR vaccine yet, which means he has no protection against measles, mumps, or rubella. Measles is extremely contagious - one of the most contagious diseases we know of. And while many people think of it as just a rash and fever, it can cause serious complications, including brain inflammation and death."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "But his heart condition - does that make these diseases more dangerous for him?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's an excellent question. Generally speaking, children with underlying medical conditions, including heart conditions, can be at higher risk for complications from vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, influenza can be particularly hard on children with heart conditions. However, Leo's heart defect has been repaired and his cardiologist says he's doing well, which is very positive."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "I'm also thinking about the preschool environment. When children are together in groups, they're exposed to more illnesses. Has Leo been getting sick a lot at preschool?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Actually, yes. He's had several colds this year, and he had a really bad stomach bug in March. He missed almost a week of school."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Is that related to not being vaccinated?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Colds are caused by many different viruses that we don't vaccinate against, so those wouldn't be prevented by vaccines. However, there are vaccines that can prevent some causes of stomach illness, like rotavirus, which is given in infancy. Leo would have missed that window. But the point is, being in a preschool environment does increase exposure to various illnesses."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "So what do you recommend? Should we try to catch him up all at once, or spread things out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I don't think we should rush into a decision today. I'd like to propose a few steps. First, I want to consult with a colleague who specializes in immunology and vaccine hesitancy. Second, I'd like to get Leo's records from his cardiac surgery and potentially touch base with his cardiologist to make sure there are no concerns from a cardiac standpoint."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Would his cardiologist have concerns about vaccines?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Most likely not, but I want to be thorough. Children with heart conditions are typically encouraged to get all standard vaccines because they're at higher risk from infections. But given your specific concerns and Leo's history, I think it's worth a quick consultation."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "And what about the preschool timeline? Should they be exploring a medical exemption while we're figuring this out?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I think that's premature right now. A medical exemption is appropriate when there's a true medical contraindication to vaccination. What Leo experienced - fever and irritability - is not typically considered a contraindication to future vaccines. However, we could consider a modified schedule that might address your concerns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "What would a modified schedule look like?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "There are a few approaches we could take. One option is to spread out the vaccines so Leo receives fewer at each visit. This doesn't reduce the overall number of vaccines, but it does mean fewer injections at once, which might feel more manageable for you and might help us identify if there's a specific vaccine causing reactions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Would that take longer to get him caught up?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Yes, it would. Instead of catching up in two or three visits, it might take four or five visits spread over several months. But if that's what you need to feel comfortable moving forward, it's an option we can consider."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "What about the DTaP specifically? That's the one we're most worried about since that's the one he reacted to."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "We have a few options for DTaP. We could pretreat Leo with acetaminophen before the vaccine to reduce the risk of fever. We could also monitor him here in the office for 30 minutes after the vaccine so you have immediate support if he has a reaction. And we could give the DTaP by itself at a visit separate from other vaccines, so if there is a reaction, we know exactly what caused it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "It sounds like there's a lot of flexibility in how we approach this. What I'm hearing is that you both want to protect Leo, but you're carrying a lot of fear from that first experience. Is that accurate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Yes, exactly. We're not anti-vaccine or anything like that. We're just scared."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "And we feel guilty. Like we've already put him at risk by waiting this long."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I want to address that guilt directly. You made a decision based on a frightening experience, and you sought to protect your child. That's what parents do. Now you're here, seeking information and trying to make the best decision going forward. That's exactly what you should be doing, and there's no reason to feel guilty about that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "I agree. You're here, you're engaged, you're asking questions. That's what matters now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Thank you. That means a lot. So what happens next? What do we need to do?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Here's what I propose. I'll reach out to your son's cardiologist with your permission to confirm there are no cardiac concerns about proceeding with vaccines. I'll also consult with our immunology specialist about the best approach given Leo's history. Then I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks where we can discuss a specific plan."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Would we start vaccines at that appointment, or would that be another planning meeting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That depends on how you feel and what we learn from the consultations. We could potentially start at that visit if you feel ready, or we could use it as another discussion and schedule vaccines for a later date. There's no pressure either way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "And I can work on getting you information about the school requirements, exemption processes if needed, and timeline. I can also connect you with some resources about vaccine safety if you want to do more reading on your own."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Yes, I'd like that. I've been reading things online, but I don't always know what sources to trust."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "I completely understand. There's a lot of misinformation out there. I'll send you some links to reliable, evidence-based sources. The CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics both have good parent-focused information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Can I ask - what would you do if this was your child?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's a question I get asked a lot, and I want to answer it honestly. If my child had the reaction Leo had, I would be scared too. But knowing what I know about vaccine safety and the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases, I would move forward with vaccination. I might ask for some of the accommodations we discussed - spreading out the vaccines, pretreating with fever reducer, monitoring closely. But I would vaccinate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Even with the heart condition?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Especially with the heart condition. Children with underlying health conditions are more vulnerable to complications from diseases. That being said, every family has to make the decision that feels right for them, and I'm here to support you whatever you decide."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "What if we decide we want to do some vaccines but not others? Is that an option?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Legally, yes, that's your right as parents. From a medical standpoint, I strongly recommend all the standard childhood vaccines because each one protects against serious diseases. But if you want to prioritize certain vaccines over others, we can discuss that. For example, if you're most worried about measles given the outbreaks, we could prioritize MMR."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "Though keep in mind that schools usually require specific vaccines, so a selective approach might still create issues with the preschool requirement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Right, that makes sense. I think we need to go home and talk about this more, just the two of us. But I'm feeling a lot better than when we walked in here."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Me too. I appreciate that you're not pushing us or making us feel bad about our concerns."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's important to me. This has to be a decision you both feel comfortable with. Now, before you leave, I do want to examine Leo if he's available, just to establish baseline care and make sure everything looks good overall."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "He's in the waiting room with my mother. Should I go get him?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Yes, please. And we can continue talking while I examine him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Okay, I'll be right back."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "While she's getting Leo, can I get your contact information so I can send you those resources we discussed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Sure. My email is [email protected]. You can send everything there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "Perfect. I'll get that out to you by tomorrow. And please don't hesitate to reach out if questions come up as you're processing all this information."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "This is Leo. Leo, this is Dr. Chen and Ms. Maria. They're going to help make sure you're healthy and strong."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Hi Leo! It's nice to meet you. I like your shirt - are those dinosaurs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "Yeah! This one is a T-Rex. He's my favorite."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "T-Rex is a great choice. He's pretty tough, right? Just like you're going to be. Leo, I'm going to do a quick checkup if that's okay. It won't hurt at all. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs and look in your ears."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "Okay. Will I get a shot today?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Not today, sweetheart. Dr. Chen is just checking to make sure everything is working right."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's right. No shots today. Can you take a big breath in for me? Good! And another one. Perfect. Your lungs sound great. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. It might feel a little cold."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "It tickles!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I bet it does! You're doing great. Leo, do you like going to preschool?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "Yes! I have lots of friends there. We play blocks and paint and yesterday we had a turtle visit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "A turtle visit? That sounds exciting! What was the turtle's name?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "Shelly! She was really slow and she ate lettuce."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That sounds like a great day. Okay Leo, I'm all done with my checkup. You were very brave. Can you give me a high five?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "patient",
    "content": "High five!"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Great job! Leo, you can go back to the waiting room with Grandma if you want. Mom and Dad are going to talk to me for just a couple more minutes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Go ahead, sweetie. Grandma is right out there. We'll be out in a minute."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "So, Leo looks wonderful. His heart sounds completely normal - you'd never know he had surgery. His lungs are clear, ears look good, no concerns at all from a physical standpoint. He's a healthy four-year-old boy."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "That's good to hear. So there's no medical reason he couldn't handle vaccines?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Based on what I see today, no. But again, I want to confirm with cardiology and with our vaccine specialist before we make a final plan. What I can tell you is that he's healthy and thriving, which is wonderful."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "He's such a good kid. We just want to make the right choices for him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "And that's exactly what you're doing. You're gathering information, asking questions, being thoughtful about this decision. That's good parenting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "I agree completely. Now, let's schedule that follow-up appointment. How does two weeks from today work for you both?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "I'll need to check my work schedule, but I think that should be fine. Should we both be here for that appointment?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "If possible, yes. I think it's important that you're both part of the decision-making process. We'll want to discuss the specific vaccine plan, and I want you both to feel comfortable with whatever we decide."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "We'll make it work. This is important."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "And you can call me anytime before that appointment if questions come up. Sometimes people think of things after they leave, and I'm happy to talk through concerns over the phone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "Thank you. We really appreciate how much time you've both spent with us today."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "This is exactly what this time is for. These are important decisions, and they deserve careful thought and discussion. I'm glad you felt comfortable bringing your concerns to us."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Can I ask one more question? What happens if Leo does have another reaction to a vaccine? Should we come to the ER, or call you, or what?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's a great question to ask. Let me give you clear guidance on that. If Leo develops a fever after a vaccine, you can give him acetaminophen or ibuprofen at home. If the fever is under 104 and he's acting relatively normal - drinking fluids, can be comforted, making eye contact with you - you can manage it at home and call our nurse line for guidance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "And if it's higher than 104?"
  },
  {

But I also want to give you my direct nurse line. If you're concerned about anything after a vaccine, you can call that number and speak to one of our triage nurses right away."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Exactly. And I want to emphasize again - the reaction Leo had before, while scary, was not dangerous. High fever and irritability are uncomfortable, but they resolve. True dangerous reactions to vaccines are extremely rare. We're talking about things like severe allergic reactions, and those typically happen within minutes of the vaccine, which is why we always ask people to wait in the office for 15 minutes after vaccines."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "That's understandable. Stressful experiences can affect our memories. Going forward, if you decide to proceed with vaccines, I'll make sure you know to wait 15-30 minutes after each vaccine. We have a comfortable waiting area, and it's just a precaution."

    "speaker": "social_worker",

    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "My mother has been very supportive. She's the one who encouraged us to come in today. She had six children and says she never had any serious problems with vaccines."

    "speaker": "father",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "She doesn't say it in a mean way. She just doesn't understand why we're so nervous."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "Everyone's experience is different. Your mother didn't have a child with a heart condition, and presumably didn't have the frightening vaccine reaction experience that you had. It's natural that your perspective would be different from hers."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "And actually, having her support could be really valuable. Even if she doesn't fully understand your concerns, having her there to help with Leo during the appointments could be helpful."

    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "That's true. She's great with him."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "One more thing I want to mention - there are also some complementary approaches that might help Leo be more comfortable with the injection process itself, if we move forward with vaccines. Distraction techniques, numbing cream for the injection site, things like that. We can talk more about those options at the next visit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "I've heard about the numbing cream. Does that really work?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "clinician",
    "content": "It can help, yes. It doesn't eliminate all sensation, but it can reduce the pain of the needle stick. Some parents find it very helpful, others feel it's not worth the extra step. It's really a personal preference."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "father",
    "content": "We'll think about that too. It sounds like there are a lot of ways to make this easier."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "social_worker",
    "content": "There really are. And I think one of the most important things is that you're approaching this thoughtfully and deliberately, rather than rushing in or avoiding it altogether. That middle path of careful consideration is exactly right."

    "speaker": "mother",
    "content": "Thank you. I think we're ready to go talk to Leo and my mom now. We have a lot to think about."

I also have lymphedema in my right arm from the surgery, and I'm hoping to get some help managing these ongoing issues so I can get back to feeling more like myself again."

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "As far as I know, it's stable - no recurrence. I'm on Tamoxifen to help prevent it from coming back, and I have regular surveillance appointments. But I have to admit, I do get anxious about every little symptom, wondering if it could be something more serious."
    },
    {
      "role": "agent",
      "content": "Understood. That anxiety is very common for survivors.\n\nTo clarify your medical conditions: breast cancer - stable, in remission on Tamoxifen. Lymphedema in right arm - is that stable, improving, or worsening?"
    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "It's mostly stable, but it does get worse when I'm active or when it's hot outside. I try to manage it, but the swelling can be frustrating, especially because I'm trying to get back to doing more normal activities."

      "role": "agent",

    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "It seems to be stable on medication. I take Levothyroxine daily and my levels have been okay at my last check, but honestly, it's hard to tell how much the thyroid issue contributes to the fatigue versus everything else."
    },
    {
      "role": "agent",
      "content": "Understood. That can be difficult to distinguish.\n\nLet me document your medications. You mentioned Tamoxifen and Levothyroxine. \n\nFor the Tamoxifen - what is the dose, and how do you take it?"
    },
    {
      "role": "patient",
      "content": "It's 20 milligrams, and I take it once a day."

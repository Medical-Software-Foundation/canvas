# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists. It ensures timely detection and intervention to enhance patient safety and medication efficacy.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. From this group, a subset is selected for screening based on specific criteria: patients must have been on the medication for at least four weeks and not have undergone a side effect screening in the past three months. 

Exclusion criteria are clearly defined to ensure the screening is focused and relevant. Patients with known allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications, those hospitalized for unrelated acute conditions, and those who have discontinued the medication for more than four weeks are excluded from the screening process.

The diagnostic interventions involve a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history and current symptoms. A standardized questionnaire is administered to assess common side effects associated with GLP-1 medications, such as gastrointestinal issues, pancreatitis, and thyroid-related symptoms. If the questionnaire indicates potential side effects, appropriate laboratory tests, including serum amylase and lipase levels for pancreatitis and thyroid function tests, are conducted.

For a screening to be considered successful, any identified side effects must be documented, and findings communicated clearly to the patient. This includes educating the patient on potential side effects and their management. If significant side effects are identified or if the patient has concerns about their medication, a follow-up consultation with a healthcare provider is recommended. All screening processes and outcomes are documented in the patient's electronic health record for future reference.

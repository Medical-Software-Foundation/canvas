# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, enhancing patient safety and therapeutic outcomes.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients currently on GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. From this group, a subset is selected for screening based on specific criteria, including a minimum medication duration of four weeks and the absence of a side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are also defined to ensure accurate assessment, excluding patients with allergies to GLP-1 medications, recent discontinuation, current hospitalization, or those under palliative care.

Diagnostic interventions involve structured interviews or questionnaires to assess common side effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, injection site reactions, and signs of pancreatitis. Laboratory tests may be conducted if symptoms warrant further investigation. The protocol also emphasizes reviewing patient-reported outcomes and self-monitoring data related to blood glucose levels and weight changes.

Successful screening is characterized by the identification and documentation of new or worsening side effects, clear communication of findings to the patient, and recommendations for further consultation if necessary. A follow-up plan is established for re-evaluation or additional diagnostic testing.

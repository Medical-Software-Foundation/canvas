  - title: "CDC's Concussion Return-to-Play Protocol for Safe Sports Resumption"
    description: "This protocol outlines the CDC's guidelines for safely returning individuals to sports after a concussion. It includes criteria for screening, exclusion, and diagnostic interventions, ensuring symptom-free progression through stages. The protocol emphasizes baseline assessments, symptom monitoring, and gradual activity increase, with continuous healthcare evaluation. Successful screens require symptom resolution, cognitive and physical recovery, and medical clearance, ensuring informed consent and education on concussion risks. The goal is to minimize injury risk and promote long-term neurological health for athletes of all ages and competition levels."

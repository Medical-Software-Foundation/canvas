Administer a standardized questionnaire to assess common side effects associated with GLP-1 medications, including gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), pancreatitis, and thyroid-related issues. Perform necessary laboratory tests if indicated by the questionnaire responses, such as serum amylase and lipase levels for pancreatitis, and thyroid function tests if thyroid-related symptoms are reported."];

### Purpose of the Protocol:
To update the USPSTF 2012 recommendation on screening for cervical cancer based on evidence review and decision analysis model evaluations. The goal is to optimize screening strategies in terms of the starting and ending ages for screening, screening intervals, and to assess the effectiveness, benefits, and harms associated with different screening methodologies (cytology alone, high-risk human papillomavirus [hrHPV] testing alone, or cotesting with cytology and hrHPV).

### Studied Group:
The targeted population for the updated recommendations includes:
- Women aged 21 to 65 years for screening
- Specific recommendations divide these women into subgroups: those aged 21 to 29 years, and those aged 30 to 65 years
- Exclusions are made for women older than 65 with adequate prior screening, women younger than 21 years, and women who have undergone a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and without a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer.

### Recommendations:
1. **For Women Aged 21 to 29 Years**: Screening is recommended every 3 years with cervical cytology alone.
2. **For Women Aged 30 to 65 Years**: Options include screening every 3 years with cytology alone, every 5 years with hrHPV testing alone, or every 5 years with hrHPV testing in combination with cytology (cotesting).
3. **Against Screening in Certain Populations**:
   - Women younger than 21 years, due to the harms outweighing the benefits.
   - Women older than 65 years who have had adequate prior screening and are not at high risk for cervical cancer, as benefits do not outweigh potential harms.
   - Women who have had a hysterectomy with the removal of the cervix and without a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer, as there’s no benefit.

### Summary:
The protocol emphasizes reducing cervical cancer mortality and incidence through tailored screening strategies. The actions recommended involve initiating screening at age 21 with cytology alone until 29 years, followed by the option of continued cytology alone or incorporating hrHPV testing from age 30 to 65. The protocol recognizes the importance of individualized clinical decisions and also outlines populations for whom screening is not advised due to lack of benefit or potential harm.

### Target Population
Designed for managing patient follow-ups based on risk stratification and recent phone call interactions. Suitable for a diverse patient population where follow-up care is essential, particularly for those who have been stratified into varying risk categories—Low, Medium, High Risk, and High Risk - Unstable.
### Recommendations
Leverage patient interviews and appointment data to determine if follow-up actions are necessary. It checks:

1. Risk Stratification: To understand the urgency of follow-up based on patient risk levels.
2. Upcoming Appointments: To ensure patients have follow-ups scheduled within the appropriate risk period.
3. Phone Call Records: To verify if the patient has been contacted recently.
 
Actions:

If no follow-up appointment is scheduled within the appropriate risk period, the protocol recommends immediate action to contact the patient.
If the patient has been contacted within the past week, the protocol suggests scheduling the next review for the following week.
### Importance
Ensures timely follow-up care by automating the tracking of patient interactions and appointments. Supporting clinicians in maintaining adherence to care plans and risk management strategies. By automating these processes, it reduces manual tracking errors and helps clinicians focus on direct patient care.
### Conclusion
Maintaining effective patient follow-up by integrating risk stratification with appointment tracking and phone call records. It ensures that patients receive timely follow-ups based on their risk level, ultimately improving patient care and clinician workflow efficiency.

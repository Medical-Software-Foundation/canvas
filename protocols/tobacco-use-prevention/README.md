# Primary Care Interventions for Prevention and Cessation of Tobacco Use in Children and Adolescents

## Purpose of the Protocol
To update the 2013 recommendation by reviewing the evidence on primary care interventions aimed at preventing and ceasing tobacco use among children and adolescents.

## Target Population
- School-aged children and adolescents (age < 18 years).

## Recommendations
- Prevent Initiation:
    - Primary care clinicians should provide interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent initiation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents. (Grade B recommendation).
- Cessation:
    - Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of primary care–feasible interventions for the cessation of tobacco use among school-aged children and adolescents. (I statement).

## Importance
- Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the US.
- Each year, an estimated 480,000 deaths in adults are attributable to tobacco use, including deaths from secondhand smoke.
- Every day, about 1,600 youth aged 12 to 17 years smoke their first cigarette.
- Approximately 5.6 million adolescents alive today will die prematurely from a smoking-related illness.
- While conventional cigarette use has declined among children, use of e-cigarettes (which contain addictive nicotine) has rapidly increased.
- Exposure to nicotine during adolescence can harm the developing brain, affecting cognition, attention, and mood.

## Conclusion
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that primary care–feasible behavioral interventions, including education or brief counseling, to prevent tobacco use in school-aged children and adolescents have a moderate net benefit. There is insufficient evidence to determine the balance of benefits and harms of primary care interventions for tobacco cessation among school-aged children and adolescents who already smoke due to a lack of adequately powered studies on behavioral counseling interventions and studies on medications.

### Target Population
Patients who are currently taking antipsychotic medications. 
### Recommendations
Undergo two specific tests annually:

1. A1C Test - to monitor blood glucose levels.
2. Lipid Panel - to check cholesterol levels.
If these tests have not been performed in the past year, the protocol will generate reminders and recommendations for clinicians to order these tests.
### Importance
Regular monitoring through these tests is crucial for patients on antipsychotic medications as these drugs can influence metabolic and cardiovascular health. The A1C test helps in detecting potential glucose-related issues, and the lipid panel helps in assessing cardiovascular risk. 
### Conclusion
Healthcare providers can streamline the process of monitoring patients on antipsychotics, ensuring that important health metrics are tracked on a regular basis. It helps in maintaining a structured approach to patient care, improving outcomes and reducing the risk of medication-related health issues. The protocol automates reminders for necessary lab tests, which can enhance clinician efficiency and patient safety.

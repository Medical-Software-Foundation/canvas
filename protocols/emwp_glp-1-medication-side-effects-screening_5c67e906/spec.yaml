    description: "This protocol outlines the systematic screening process for identifying side effects in patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists. It includes criteria for patient selection, exclusion, and diagnostic interventions. The process involves reviewing medical history, administering questionnaires, and conducting lab tests if necessary.

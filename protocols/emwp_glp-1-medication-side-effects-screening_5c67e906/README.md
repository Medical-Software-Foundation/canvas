# Summary of the Protocol for Systematic Screening of Side Effects in Patients on GLP-1 Medications

The protocol aims to systematically identify and manage side effects in patients prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists, ensuring patient safety and effective medication use.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population of all patients currently on GLP-1 medications, such as liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. It then narrows down to a subset of patients who have been on these medications for at least four weeks and have not undergone side effect screening in the past three months. Exclusion criteria are applied to ensure the appropriate selection of patients for screening. The protocol outlines diagnostic interventions, including medical history reviews, questionnaires, and laboratory tests, to detect potential side effects. Successful screenings involve documenting side effects, communicating findings to patients, and recommending follow-up consultations if necessary.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population**: Includes all patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists.
- **Subset for Screening**: 
  - Patients on GLP-1 medications for at least 4 weeks.
  - Patients without a side effect screening in the last 3 months.
  
- **Exclusion Criteria**:
  - Patients with allergies or contraindications to GLP-1 medications.
  - Hospitalized patients for conditions unrelated to GLP-1 side effects.
  - Patients who discontinued GLP-1 medications over 4 weeks before screening.

- **Diagnostic Interventions**:
  - Comprehensive review of medical history and symptoms.
  - Standardized questionnaire for common side effects (e.g., gastrointestinal issues, pancreatitis, thyroid problems).
  - Laboratory tests like serum amylase and lipase if indicated.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens**:
  - Documenting any side effects experienced.
  - Communicating findings and educating patients on side effects and management.
  - Recommending follow-up consultations for significant side effects or patient concerns.
  - Recording the screening process and outcomes in the patient's electronic health record.

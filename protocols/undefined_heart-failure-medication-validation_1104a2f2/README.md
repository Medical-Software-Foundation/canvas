# Summary of Clinical Protocol for Validation of Heart Failure Medication Usage

The primary goal of this protocol is to ensure that heart failure medications are prescribed appropriately within the healthcare system, particularly for patients who do not have an active diagnosis of heart failure.

The protocol begins by identifying the initial population, which includes all patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication. From this group, a subset is considered for screening: those who lack an active heart failure diagnosis in their medical records. The protocol then outlines exclusion criteria, diagnostic interventions, and conditions for successful screening to guide healthcare providers in evaluating the necessity of the medication.

### Important Information:

- **Initial Population:** All patients with an active prescription for heart failure medication.
  
- **Subset for Screening:** Patients without an active heart failure diagnosis in their medical records.

- **Exclusion Criteria:**
  - Patients with a history of heart failure that is inactive or in remission.
  - Patients prescribed heart failure medication for off-label use with documented clinical justification.
  - Patients involved in clinical trials with appropriate documentation.

- **Diagnostic Interventions:**
  - Review of medical history and records to confirm the absence of a heart failure diagnosis.
  - Consultation with the prescribing healthcare provider to discuss the rationale for the medication.
  - Conducting diagnostic tests, such as echocardiograms or BNP/NT-proBNP levels, if necessary.

- **Conditions for Successful Screens:**
  - Confirmation of a heart failure diagnosis, allowing continuation of the medication.
  - Identification of an alternative clinical justification for the medication, allowing continuation.
  - Recommendation for discontinuation of the medication or further evaluation if no justification is found.

This protocol aims to optimize patient care by ensuring that heart failure medications are used appropriately and effectively, preventing unnecessary medication use, and identifying patients who may require further evaluation for potential heart failure diagnosis.

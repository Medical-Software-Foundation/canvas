### Target Population
Overweight or obese patients with a BMI over 30. Those who are self-paying for their medications or have insurance with prior authorization approved. Consider patients who are at risk due to specific contraindications, such as a history of pancreatitis, gallstones, or medullary thyroid cancer.
### Recommendations
Initiate GLP-1 agonists (Wegovy, Mounjaro, or Saxenda) for eligible patients. These medications are used to aid weight loss in individuals with a BMI over 30. Ensuring the patient does not have contraindications and that their payment status meets the criteria for initiating therapy.
### Importance
Streamlines the decision-making process for prescribing weight-loss medications. By automating eligibility checks and recommendations. Supporting clinicians in providing evidence-based treatment while avoiding potential adverse effects in patients with contraindications. Integrates clinical decision support with patient records confirming the right patients receive the appropriate treatment.
### Conclusion
The identification and recommendation of GLP-1 agonists for weight management. It evaluates patient data for BMI, payment status, and contraindications before making a recommendation.

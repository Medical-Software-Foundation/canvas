### Target Population

Adults who are undergoing screening for sleep apnea, specifically those who have participated in a **Weight Loss Program Status Questionnaire** with a status indicating "Condition screening" or have completed the STOP-BANG questionnaire.

### Recommendations

**Screening**:

- Clinicians should use the STOP-BANG questionnaire to screen patients who meet the above criteria for sleep apnea risk. If the STOP-BANG score is 3 or higher, a sleep study should be recommended.

**Diagnosis**:

- If the sleep study results are abnormal (indicating sleep apnea), clinicians should refer the patient to a sleep medicine specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Follow-Up**:

- If a patient has a STOP-BANG score of less than 3 or a normal sleep study, no further immediate action is required unless symptoms persist or worsen.

### Importance

Sleep apnea is a common but often undiagnosed condition that can lead to serious health issues, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and daytime fatigue, which can significantly affect a patient’s quality of life. Early identification and management of sleep apnea can prevent complications, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare costs.

### Conclusion

This protocol is designed to activate for patients specifically flagged for sleep apnea screening based on their involvement in a weight loss program or completion of relevant screening questionnaires. By automating the screening process with the STOP-BANG questionnaire and ensuring timely recommendations for further testing and specialist referral, the protocol supports proactive, efficient, and effective patient care.

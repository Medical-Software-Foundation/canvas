  - title: "CDC's Concussion Return-to-Play Protocol for Athletes"
    description: "This protocol outlines the CDC's guidelines for safely returning athletes to sports after a concussion. It includes criteria for initial population, screening subset, exclusion, diagnostic interventions, and conditions for successful screening. The goal is to ensure athletes are symptom-free, have returned to baseline cognitive function, and can complete a graduated return-to-play protocol without symptoms, with final clearance by a healthcare professional. This approach minimizes further injury risk and promotes long-term health."

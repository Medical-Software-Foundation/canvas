## **Who It’s For & Benefits**

Canvas’s sleep medicine EMR is designed to support specialists and care teams delivering comprehensive, patient-centered sleep care. Whether you’re diagnosing complex disorders or managing ongoing treatment, the platform adapts to your workflows while improving efficiency and collaboration.

* Sleep clinics diagnose conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and narcolepsy  
* Providers managing patients with comorbid conditions like obesity, anxiety, and depression  
* In-person and telehealth sleep care teams coordinating diagnosis, follow-up, and long-term treatment

## **Sleep Conditions & Comorbidities Managed**

Canvas sleep medicine EMR is designed to streamline both documentation and diagnosis through built-in protocols and default workflows. This ensures consistent, efficient, and accurate care for a wide range of conditions, including:

* **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), and narcolepsy** – standardized workflows help providers capture patient history, track sleep study data, and document treatment plans.  
* **Obesity, anxiety, depression** – integrated protocols support assessment of common comorbidities, allowing providers to address the broader health context of sleep disorders.

## **Scope of Treatments**

The EMR supports a wide range of treatment approaches tailored to sleep medicine. This includes:

* **Sleep study documentation and CPAP therapy tracking** to streamline diagnosis and ensure adherence monitoring.  
* **Ongoing treatment planning and behavioral management**, such as CBT-I for insomnia or structured weight management programs.  
* **Scheduling follow-ups and monitoring outcomes** to track patient progress and adjust therapies as needed.

Treatment options may also involve pharmacological support for RLS and narcolepsy, as well as lifestyle modification programs to address obesity and related comorbidities.

## **Care Delivery Models in Sleep Medicine** 

Care teams interact with patients through a combination of in-person office visits and telemedicine services, including secure text messaging, phone consultations, and video conferencing. This multi-modal approach ensures continuous and accessible care for patients with varying needs and schedules.

## **Protocols**

The most-used protocols include CPAP adherence monitoring, CBT-I for insomnia, and standardized assessment tools like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the STOP-Bang questionnaire for sleep apnea. Regular follow-ups and adjustments to treatment plans are crucial, particularly for patients with comorbid conditions requiring comprehensive and coordinated care.

Key protocols supported include:

* **Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS):** Streamlines assessment of daytime sleepiness.  
* **Insomnia screening questionnaire:** Helps quickly identify severity and patterns of sleep disruption.  
* **RLS symptom tracking:** Provides structured documentation for improved diagnosis and monitoring.  
* **CPAP compliance log:** Tracks adherence for both clinical outcomes and insurance requirements.

These tools not only standardize care but also enhance documentation efficiency, improve billing accuracy, and save time for both providers and staff.

## **Canvas vs. Other Sleep Medicine EMRs**

When choosing an EMR for sleep medicine, the difference often comes down to adaptability, integration, and ease of use. Canvas stands out for its flexibility and developer-friendly design, helping practices configure workflows quickly without sacrificing clinical depth. 

Compared with traditional sleep medicine EMRs, Canvas offers faster customization, smoother integration with diagnostic data, and stronger support for telehealth and patient engagement.

| Evaluation Criteria | Canvas | Other Sleep Medicine EMRs |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Ease of Use & Workflow Efficiency** | Streamlined, clinician-centered design with quick configuration options | Often rigid workflows that require vendor support to adjust |
| **Diagnostic Integration** (e.g., sleep study data handling) | Native support for integrating sleep study reports and structured documentation | Limited or delayed integration; often requires third-party tools |
| **Treatment Tracking** (e.g., CPAP compliance) | Built-in tools for tracking CPAP adherence, behavioral interventions, and ongoing care | May offer CPAP tracking but with less flexibility for behavioral or lifestyle documentation |
| **Telehealth Readiness** | Telehealth-friendly features designed for virtual consults and follow-ups | Telehealth may be available, but usually as an add-on or external module |
| **Customization with SDK & FHIR API** | Developer-friendly, with open SDK and FHIR API for rapid configuration and custom workflows | Limited customization, typically requiring vendor intervention or lengthy implementation |
| **Patient Portal** | Intuitive portal that supports patient engagement, documentation access, and treatment tracking | Portals often exist but can be clunky, harder to use, or less integrated with treatment data |

Canvas makes it easy to adapt to the unique needs of sleep medicine practices, whether you’re handling complex diagnostic data, coordinating CPAP therapy, or supporting patients through telehealth.

### **Built-in Extensions**

These extensions come built into the system, and you can update them as you continue improving your care model over time. They’re designed to streamline everyday clinical tasks by automating key steps in the care journey. For example, they can initialize screening workflows, set up reminders for follow-up visits, and even generate personalized care pathways based on patient needs. By reducing manual work, these tools not only save time but also support more consistent, high-quality care delivery.

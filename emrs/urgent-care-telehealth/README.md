## **Who It’s For & Benefits**

This urgent care EMR is built to support a range of care settings that require rapid, accurate management of common acute conditions. Intended users include:

- Urgent care and retail clinics focused on walk-in patient volume
- Hybrid primary care practices integrating telehealth for acute visits
- Medicaid and Medicare-focused walk-in clinics seeking compliance and efficiency

Canvas Medical’s platform adapts flexibly to existing workflows through configurable tools and developer-friendly extensibility. This enables care teams to standardize documentation, streamline clinical workflows, and improve operational control without disrupting established practices.

## **Urgent Care Conditions Managed**

The EMR supports documentation and clinical workflows for a broad range of non-emergency conditions, including:

- Respiratory infections (e.g., common cold, bronchitis)
- Minor injuries (e.g., sprains, cuts)
- Gastrointestinal issues (e.g., nausea, diarrhea)
- Urinary tract infections
- Skin conditions (e.g., rashes, infections)

Care protocols within the system are mapped explicitly to these conditions, enabling structured, evidence-based workflows that promote consistent patient assessments and treatment decisions.

## **Scope of Treatments**

Canvas’s urgent care EMR supports comprehensive treatment pathways tailored to typical urgent care complaints. Clinicians can prescribe medications directly within the system and document over-the-counter recommendations and home care instructions efficiently.

The platform also facilitates referral workflows, seamlessly transitioning patients to in-person or specialist care when necessary, while maintaining a coherent patient record.

## **Urgent Care Delivery Models**

Care teams interact with patients through a variety of virtual methods, including secure text messaging, phone calls, and video visits.

The EMR is optimized for seamless integration of these communication channels, allowing providers to switch between them as necessary while maintaining a complete and coherent patient record.

This flexibility ensures that patients receive timely and appropriate care regardless of their preferred mode of communication.

## **Protocols**

Canvas’s EMR integrates decision support tools to guide clinicians through established urgent care protocols. Common protocols include:

- Standardized triage procedures
- Symptom checklists for respiratory and GI complaints
- Evidence-based treatment pathways for minor injuries
- UTI management protocols
- Skin condition evaluation and treatment workflows

These protocols enhance documentation speed and improve billing accuracy by ensuring proper coding and compliance with clinical guidelines.

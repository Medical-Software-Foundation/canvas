## **Who It’s For and Its Benefits** 

Chronic care management software is designed for healthcare providers aiming to streamline the care of patients with chronic conditions. It is tailored for practices including:

* Primary care  
* Specialty clinics  
* Integrated health systems


Chronic care management platforms help practitioners coordinate patient care by managing data and monitoring patient health. For providers, this means improved workflow, and for the patient, it may mean better outcomes. Healthcare organizations can also rely on this software to improve internal communication and to provide timely interventions for the patient. 

Canvas settings, [integrations](https://www.canvasmedical.com/extensions), default content, and protocols have been tailored for these conditions, treatments, and settings of care.

## **Chronic Conditions Managed**

Canvas provides tailored management protocols for various chronic conditions, and each protocol is designed to meet the unique needs of the condition being treated. For example, the management protocols for diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) differ significantly in terms of patient monitoring, treatment plans, and data handling.

### **Specific Management Protocols**

The EMR system is optimized to manage chronic conditions commonly affecting patients above 30\. These conditions include diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, arthritis, heart disease, COPD, and gastrointestinal issues, including IBS and Crohn's disease. 

### **Diabetes Monitoring** 

Canvas’ diabetes protocol includes regular monitoring of key metrics such as blood glucose levels, A1c, and insulin usage, with automated alerts for out-of-range values. The system also tracks patient adherence to prescribed medication regimens, lifestyle interventions (such as diet and exercise), and other factors that may affect blood sugar control, such as stress or illness. 

### **COPD Management** 

COPD management focuses on respiratory function monitoring, with particular attention to lung function tests. Alerts and reminders are set up to ensure patients take their medications and attend follow-up visits.

### **Gastrointestinal (GI) Protocols**

The chronic care management EMR tracks GI symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Patients can report symptoms directly into the system through patient portals or via connected wearable devices, which feed data into the EMR for analysis.

It can also identify flaring patterns for conditions such as Crohn’s, giving providers a clearer picture of disease progression and remission. 

**Scope of Treatments**

Healthcare developers can leverage the Canvas [Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/sdk/) to create personalized protocols for managing chronic issues, ensuring that care is condition-specific and aligns with treatment responses and lifestyle factors.

Canvas seamlessly integrates with a variety of third-party services to enhance its chronic care management platform. These integrations may include:

* Remote monitoring integrations for remotely tracking patient health  
* Lab integrations to access important test results for chronic conditions  
* Diagnostic imaging integrations to integrate imaging results (from a colonoscopy, as an example)

## **Settings of Care**

Care teams interact with patients primarily through virtual means such as secure text, phone, and video calls, ensuring both synchronous and asynchronous communication. In-person visits are minimized but available when necessary, especially for physical examinations or procedures that cannot be conducted remotely. The system facilitates seamless communication and collaboration among care team members to provide continuous and coordinated care.

## **Protocols**

Most-used protocols include regular blood glucose monitoring for diabetes, bone density scans for osteoporosis, chemotherapy schedules for cancer, and pulmonary function tests for COPD. The EMR ensures adherence to evidence-based guidelines and integrates reminders for routine screenings, medication adherence, and follow-up appointments, tailored to the specific needs of each patient.

Canvas allows teams to build and customize protocols rather than relying on fixed templates. These may include:

* Diabetes: blood glucose monitoring protocols  
* Osteoporosis: bone density scan scheduling  
* COPD: pulmonary function testing schedules  
* Hypertension: BP tracking and medication adjustments  
* Heart disease: lipid panel follow-up protocols  
* GI conditions: stool test monitoring for IBD

### **Built-in Extensions**

Canvas extensions come built into the system, and you can update them as you continue improving your care model over time. These prescription drug monitoring program extensions include:

* [New York PMP](https://www.canvasmedical.com/extensions/ny-pmp)  
* [Nebraska PDMP](https://www.canvasmedical.com/extensions/ne-pdmp)  
* [Wisconsin PDMP](https://www.canvasmedical.com/extensions/wi-pdmp)


PMP/PDMPs help practitioners identify at-risk patients. Meanwhile, [annual wellness visits](https://www.canvasmedical.com/extensions/hcc-annual-wellness-visit) focus on senior patients (over 65), helping to get ahead of potential health issues. 

### **FHIR Functionality** 

Leveraging the power of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) helps clinicians access a comprehensive view of a patient's chronic conditions. The EMR’s FHIR-native architecture captures all chronic condition data as searchable resources for custom analytics or reporting. Health organizations and trusted partners utilizing the Canvas platform can access the full capabilities of the [FHIR API](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/api/). 

## **Canvas vs. Other Chronic Care Management EMRs**

Chronic care management software can vary significantly across vendors due to differences in their underlying architectures, customization options, and support for multi-condition care. Canvas offers unique advantages with its robust features like FHIR-native data architecture, customizable care protocols, and seamless integration of telehealth and remote monitoring.

| Functionality | Canvas EMR | Third party/legacy systems |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Data Architecture | **FHIR-native** data stored as queryable resources for seamless interoperability and custom analytics | Proprietary database tables make fragmented data integration with other systems more difficult |
| Protocol Customization | **Custom SDK** allows full flexibility to create, adapt, and personalize care plans for chronic conditions | Rigid, templated protocols that limit customization options for specific patient needs |
| Virtual Care Support | **Robust telehealth integration** with video visits, secure messaging, and data sharing  | Limited telehealth functionality often requires third-party integrations or add-ons for full virtual care support |
| Workflow Flexibility | **Developer-friendly SDK** for creating custom workflows, automating tasks, and integrating third-party tools | Vendor-only changes limit customization and adaptability |
| Multi-Condition Management | **Integrated model** for managing multiple chronic conditions in a unified system, allowing holistic care coordination | Siloed modules for different conditions may not communicate well with each other |
| Reporting/Analytics | **FHIR-queryable data** supports dynamic, customizable reporting and analytics for more actionable insights | Fixed, static reports that may require manual updates or lack flexibility in extracting meaningful insights from the data |

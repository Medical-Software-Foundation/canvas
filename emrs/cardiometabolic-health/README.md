## **Who It’s For & Benefits**

This cardiometabolic health EMR is designed for providers who need a purpose-built solution to address the growing challenges of obesity, diabetes, and related conditions. By combining evidence-based tools with flexible workflows, it supports both in-person and virtual care delivery while aligning with value-based care goals. 

Whether you’re running a specialized clinic or integrating cardiometabolic management into a broader practice, this EMR helps streamline documentation, improve patient engagement, and deliver better outcomes over time.

**Ideal for:**

* Weight management clinics  
* Cardiometabolic specialty practices  
* Primary care teams with obesity/diabetes programs  
* Value-based care organizations  
* Hybrid care providers (telehealth \+ in-person)

## **Cardiometabolic & Weight Management Conditions**

This EMR is purpose-built to support the complex needs of patients with cardiometabolic and weight-related conditions. It integrates detailed patient histories, lab results, and treatment data to help clinicians deliver coordinated, evidence-based care.

**Primary conditions supported include:**

* Heart failure  
* Coronary artery disease  
* Vascular disease  
* Stroke  
* Hypertension  
* Diabetes  
* High cholesterol  
* Obesity  
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
* Anemia

**Weight-related comorbidities supported include:**

* Metabolic syndrome  
* Insulin resistance  
* Medication-induced weight gain

By consolidating data across these conditions, the EMR streamlines monitoring, treatment adjustments, and interdisciplinary care—helping teams manage risk factors more effectively and improve long-term outcomes.

## **Scope of Treatments**

This EMR supports a comprehensive range of interventions for cardiometabolic health.

**Heart-related condition management:**

* Medication management, including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins  
* Diabetes care with insulin therapy, oral hypoglycemics, and continuous glucose monitoring  
* Dialysis support for chronic kidney disease where applicable  
* Ongoing monitoring and documentation for vascular disease, heart failure, and stroke

**Weight management programs:**

* Lifestyle modification tracking, including diet, exercise, and behavioral counseling  
* Structured weight loss interventions and medication management for obesity  
* Monitoring for metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and medication-induced weight gain  
* Integration with multidisciplinary care plans for holistic patient management

The EMR can help care teams streamline workflows, track outcomes, and personalize treatment for each patient.

## **Hybrid Care Delivery for Weight Management** 

The EMR supports a hybrid care model, enabling care teams to manage patients through in-person visits, remote monitoring, and telehealth check-ins. Patients can receive guidance and follow-ups via secure messaging, phone consultations, or video visits, while in-office appointments allow for physical assessments and interventions. 

The system centralizes all interactions, ensuring care teams have real-time access to patient data, treatment progress, and lab results. This integration enhances coordination, supports continuous engagement, and allows providers to tailor interventions for individual needs, whether patients are onsite or at a distance.

## **Protocols**

The EMR incorporates evidence-based protocols designed for cardiometabolic care, streamlining clinical workflows while supporting accurate coding and billing. Key protocols include:

* **Heart Failure Management**: Guides monitoring, medication adjustments, and patient education.  
* **Diabetes Care**: Supports insulin and oral therapy management, glucose monitoring, and lifestyle counseling.  
* **Hypertension Control**: Provides structured workflows for BP tracking and treatment optimization.  
* **Obesity and Weight Management**: Facilitates lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up documentation.  
* **Chronic Kidney Disease Care**: Ensures appropriate lab monitoring, medication adjustments, and referral tracking.  
* **Hyperlipidemia Management**: Standardizes lipid monitoring and treatment interventions.

By integrating these protocols, the EMR accelerates documentation, enhances coding accuracy, and simplifies billing processes, allowing clinicians to focus on patient care.

## **Canvas vs. Other Weight Management EMRs**

| Criteria | Canvas EMR | Other Weight Management EMRs |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Ease of Use & Workflow Speed** | Intuitive interfaces and streamlined workflows designed for rapid documentation and treatment planning | Varies; may require additional training and manual data entry |
| **Integration Capabilities** | Seamless connections with devices (e.g., glucose monitors, BP cuffs), labs, and billing systems | Often limited to basic EHR integrations; device connectivity may be restricted |
| **Weight Management & Metabolic Health Protocols** | Built-in evidence-based protocols for obesity, metabolic syndrome, and related comorbidities; customizable to practice needs | Protocols may be rigid or generic; limited customization options |
| **Virtual Care & Remote Monitoring** | Supports telehealth, secure messaging, and remote patient data capture for ongoing monitoring | Telehealth and remote monitoring may require third-party add-ons |
| **Customizability with SDK & FHIR** | Developer-friendly SDK and FHIR APIs allow workflow tailoring, integrations, and extensions | Limited developer access or API flexibility |
| **Patient Engagement & Education Tools** | Interactive patient portal, automated follow-ups, and educational resources | Tools may be basic or inconsistent across platforms |

## **Who It’s For & Benefits**

Canvas Pediatrics EMR is designed to support the unique needs of pediatric teams who care for children’s growth, development, and overall well-being. By streamlining documentation, automating workflows, and simplifying communication, it helps providers deliver consistent, personalized care while keeping families engaged throughout the process. 

Pediatric therapy EMR features ensure every aspect of treatment—clinical, behavioral, and academic—is tracked and managed in one place.

**Ideal for:**

* Pediatric clinics treating ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and learning disabilities  
* Early childhood intervention programs focused on developmental milestones  
* School-based practices managing academic and social integration  
* Behavioral pediatric teams combining in-person and virtual consults

## **Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics Use Cases**

Canvas Pediatrics Therapy EMR supports care for children with diverse developmental and behavioral needs, providing tailored tools for different stages of growth. Workflows, screening templates, and care tracking are designed to adapt to age-specific requirements while ensuring continuity of care across the patient journey.

* ADHD  
* Autism spectrum disorder  
* Anxiety disorders  
* Learning disabilities

## **Scope of Treatments**

The EMR system supports a wide range of interventions for developmental and behavioral pediatrics, including behavioral therapy, medication management, and educational support. It goes beyond basic documentation by offering:

* **Developmental screening templates** are designed for age-appropriate assessments and early detection.  
* **Progress tracking tools** to measure the effectiveness of behavioral interventions over time.  
* **Therapy note workflows** tailored to the unique needs of pediatric developmental care, ensuring continuity and collaboration across providers.

This comprehensive approach helps clinicians monitor outcomes, adjust treatment plans, and coordinate seamlessly with families and schools.

## **Care Delivery Models in Pediatrics**

Care teams in pediatrics increasingly rely on hybrid models of care to meet children and families where they are. The EMR supports in-clinic therapy sessions, telehealth behavior consults, and school or home-based therapy documentation workflows. By enabling seamless communication, scheduling, and documentation across these settings, the system ensures that families experience consistent, accessible, and coordinated care—no matter the delivery model.

## **Protocols**

Common pediatric protocols include standardized assessment tools for diagnosing ADHD and autism, medication titration guidelines, developmental milestone tracking, immunization schedules, and evidence-based practices for behavioral interventions. 

By embedding these protocols directly into the EMR workflow, providers can document more quickly and accurately, while also supporting compliance with clinical standards and improving billing accuracy. This integration ensures that care teams stay aligned with best practices while streamlining the administrative side of pediatric care.

## **Canvas vs. Other Pediatric Therapy EMRs**

| Evaluation Factor | Canvas Pediatric Therapy EMR | Typical Competitor EMRs |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Pediatric-Specific Workflow Support | Tailored workflows for ADHD, autism, anxiety, and learning disabilities; developmental stage–specific templates | Often generic pediatric or general EMR workflows |
| Screening & Developmental Assessment Tools | Built-in, standardized assessment templates with automated scoring and progress tracking | Limited or separate third-party tools required |
| Hybrid Care Flexibility | Supports in-clinic, school-based, home, and telehealth sessions; seamless documentation across settings | May support in-clinic or telehealth only; integration gaps between settings |
| Customization via SDK & FHIR APIs | Developer-friendly platform enables custom templates, extensions, and integrations | Minimal developer access; limited customization options |
| Billing & Reporting for Developmental Therapies | Automated coding, encounter capture, and outcome reporting to streamline compliance | Often manual reporting; less specialized for pediatric therapies |
| Documentation & Progress Tracking | Pediatric-focused note templates, milestone tracking, and therapy session logs | Generic templates not optimized for developmental care |

Canvas Pediatric Therapy EMR stands out for its configurability, pediatric-centered workflows, and developer-friendly design. Practices can rapidly adapt the system to specific care models, integrate custom assessments, and extend functionality to match evolving therapy protocols, all while improving documentation speed, compliance, and billing accuracy.


### **Built-in Extensions**

These extensions come built into the system, and you can update them as your practice evolves. Tools like Child-Anxiety-Screening and Obesity in Children Screening help pediatric care teams streamline workflows by automatically initiating assessment forms, generating care pathways, and tracking follow-up actions. 

They reduce manual documentation, support standardized data capture, and improve consistency across patient encounters. As your practice grows or adapts to new treatment approaches, these extensions can be customized and expanded, ensuring that your pediatric behavioral EMR continues to support efficient, high-quality care over time.

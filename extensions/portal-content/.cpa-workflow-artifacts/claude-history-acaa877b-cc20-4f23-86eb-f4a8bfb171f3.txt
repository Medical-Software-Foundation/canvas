use your canvas-sdk skill to determine what the logger.py file is for; it seems unnecessary
delete the logger.py file
put the icon images in a more standard location, like images/ or assets/ or api/assets or something
use your canvas-sdk skill to create an appropriate pyproject.toml
use your cpa testing skill to fix the structure of test files, and also add more tests

is the readme up to date?
need to raise an error if visits is enabled but no note types configured. need to raise an error if a component requiring fhir is enabled but no client_id and secret configured.
let's not worry about more tests right now, let's just keep doing uat
if a component has an error in retrieving its data, then the error should be displayed in a friendly way to the end user (the patient). similarly, if there is no content, e.g. no lab reports, no visits, then a friendly message saying that shouold be displayed to the user
check the logs, errors 
you know better; use your canvas skill to get this right

} is the response from the https://plugin-testing.canvasmedical.com/plugin-io/api/portal_content/visits/notes endpoint, and the ui shows "No Visit Notes Yet" - that doesn't seem right, does it?
awesome thanks for catching that bug and change with SGN state. can you make the note listing more informative? right now they just show the date and the clinician. do you have easy access to the type of visit and could you display that too? so it says e.g. line 1: "Office visit on Wednesday, January 7, 2026" line 2 "With John Smith"

be sure to save all reports in the artifacts folder, including the overall wrap-up report too
/cost
the reports and history files should have been saved here /Users/andhines/code/temp-clones/gtm-extensions/general/portal-content/.cpa-workflow-artifacts
the target folder already exists
no git actions
/cpa:coverage
yes
--- SESSION CONTEXT COMPACTED ---
save this new coverage report in artifacts
wait a sec, why don't the api auth methods use the patient mixins?
use your canvas-sdk skill as always
rerun the security review and save a new report
save the database performance report, that should have been done with wrap up
update the claude history artifact to include all the way up to this latest message
not at all what I meant. delete that. save the claude session message history again as is done in wrap up, but run it complete again to include the messages since last creation
